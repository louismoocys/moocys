                           Hello, my name is Heather and Sydney is my hometown, Australia my country. I have more than 20 years experience working as both an IELTS tutor and an English teacher, and am a graduate of Macquarie University (Sydney). I have travelled and taught worldwide.
 
Countries I have spent time in include; Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, America, Spain, Italy, England, Austria, France, Greece and Morocco. I also taught in and managed an English language school in Japan. Each country I visit has a unique culture, I meet friendly people and eat delicious food, and I have many treasured memories of those special times.
 
In my free time I like to read and to write, and to travel. Currently in Australia, I focus on assisting others with their IELTS preparation. Knowledge of the test format is extremely important, as is an in-depth understanding of the test criteria, in addition to actual language ability. I also believe individual feedback is vital for all language learning, providing expert knowledge of the personal changes needed.</p>
